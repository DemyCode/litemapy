Contributing
============

All contributions are welcomed and encouraged. Please open an issue first if you consider contributing big changes,
so we can discuss them beforehand and avoid unnecessary work on your part because someone is already working on a similar
feature or any other complication.

Code
````
You can contribute on `GitHub <https://github.com/SmylerMC/litemapy>`_ by making a pull request.
Please follow the usual Python syntax convention, in particular:

* Module, method and variable names in snake_case
* Global constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
* Class names in CamelCase
* Lines no longer than 80 characters
* Protected members should start with an underscore and private members with two underscores

Docstrings are always appreciated, and required for your feature to appear in this documentation.
They should be written following
`the Sphinx format <https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html>`_.

Tests are also appreciated, especially for complex features.
They should live in a test module with the same name as the module that contains
the feature that's being tested, but with the *test_* prefix added.
You can follow the pattern of existing tests if you need examples.
